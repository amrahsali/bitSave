## 🏁 Hackathon Note

BitSave was developed during **Hack4Freedom 2025** — a mission-driven hackathon focused on building decentralized, censorship-resistant, and empowering digital tools for freedom.

Despite the challenges faced integrating the Breez SDK (which kept breaking initially 😅), the experience pushed us to learn, grow, and build something truly meaningful.
